### ðŸš¨ A Note About multi-window Support
The `add_multi_window` option worked by using a third-party plugin called `desktop_multi_window`, which creates new 
windows by creating a new instance of the Flutter engine for each window. Unfortunately, this approach means that any 
plugins used by the primary instance are not passed to the new instances. There are workarounds for multiwindow 
applications using plugins that would require data passed between them; As of version 2.0, `macos_ui` uses the 
`macos_window_utils` plugin under the hood, the nature of which won't work with the workarounds.   

Therefore, `add_multi_window` is disabled until multi-window is officially released in the Flutter framework itself. 

## Output ðŸ“¦

A Flutter application that:
* Targets macOS (support for other platforms can be added manually)
* Has `macos_ui` pre-installed
* Builds basic UI based on the latest version of `macos_ui`
